# Graph Algorithms: Euler Circuits and Chinese Postman Problem

## Euler Circuits

 - **Euler Path:** Path that visits each node exactly one time
 - **Euler Circuit:** Euler Path that begins and ends in the same node

### Necessary Conditions

 - **Non-Directed Graph**
     - **Euler's Circuit**
        - connected
        - each node has an even degree (number of incident edges)
     - **Euler's Path**
        - connected
        - every node except 2 nodes (beoinginig and edn)
 - **Directed Graph**
     - **Euler's Circuit**
